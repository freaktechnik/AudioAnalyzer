PerfectTone
=============

This is my Matura Work.
The goal is to create a program, which works like a chromatic tuner:
It should extract the absolute tone name from an AudioStream and display, how exact the Tone is.

Compatibility
=============
Tested and working:
Windows 7 x86_64 with Java 7
(Linux) Elementary OS Lune preview x86 with some Graphic issues, caused by the Graphicsacceleration

Download of the built Project
==============
https://www.dropbox.com/s/0pjhfbt0br7tiar/PerfectTone.jar

Running instructions
==============
If you can't run the .jar file by double-clicking it, you open a console and type "java -jar 'path/to/jar/PerfectTone.jar'".

Build-Instructions
==============

I only checked compiling with Netbeans 7. It works fine for me on Windows.
The main-class is AnalyzeAudio.java
